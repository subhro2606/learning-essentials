Shared Responsiblity/Security Model:

The security of the cloud is AWS's job and the security in the cloud is your job. 

    Managed by AWS:
    Managing AWS regions, availability zones, edge locations, which are all AWS physical networking components & the softwares thats used by many of the AWS products and services are managed by AWS.
    
    Managed by Customer:
The data you store inside AWS, the authentication & authorization process,operating systems or patches to those operating systems, firewall configuration, encryption are managed by you.

So basically when you deploy stuffs in AWS there is an element of  shared responsibility, and the amount of responsibility for you or AWS varies from Product to Product. Some products you're responsible for very little of and other the products you control and are responsible for major components or even the majority of it.

Welcome back and in this lesson, I want to really briefly touch upon how security is handled in AWS, and that's using what's known as the shared responsibility model. 
Now it sounds complicated, but it's not really. 
What you have to keep in mind is that when you're using AWS you're using AWS's network and platform, but within that is your data. 
The shared responsibility model is simply an overview of which parts you as the customer responsible for on which parts AWS manage and it's important to understand this going into the exam because you will face situations where you need to be aware depending on the product or services that you select for infrastructures. 
You need to be aware of which products and services or elements of those products or services. 
You need to worry about the security and the configuration of and which you don't. 
It's really critical that you understand this concept. 
Now don't worry about the detail for now, we'll touch on this as we go through the course. 
From this lesson's perspective, I just want you to be aware of at a broad level which things you're responsible for and which things AWS is responsible for. 
Now in a high level for the exam, if you're ever in doubt, remember these two things: the security of the cloud is AWS's job and the security in the cloud is your job. 
There are exceptions to this high level rule, but in general 90% of the situations are covered by remembering these two components but what does that really mean? A lot of these terms I'm about to use you might not be familiar yet if you've not used AWS but don't worry by the end of the course, they will be. 
Managing AWS regions, availability zones, and edge locations, which are all AWS physical networking components because that's the cloud that's up to AWS. 
You don't after all, decide where AWS puts a region. 
You don't have to pay for the data center, the power bill, or replace failed air conditioning units. 
That's all the responsibility of AWS. 
AWS are responsible for accessing secure facilities for controlling that access and ensuring that all of these components physically secured. 
So the hardware and the other global infrastructure that's AWS, who managed that as well. 
When you get into more detail, so looking at the compute storage database and networking services that AWS offers that's also entirely AWS's responsibility. 
Again there are some exceptions to this rule, but in general it's AWS's responsibility. 
Software that's used for many of the AWS products and services that is also managed by AWS. 
Now, as I go through the course, you're going to get the chance to think about design and build AWS architectures and as you do that, it's going to become clear that AWS handle various components of that and other bits they don't. 
AWS from operations perspective and a security perspective, manage the cloud. 
Now, what they don't manage is inside the cloud, which is generally your data. 
However you store your data inside AWS, you're responsible for it. 
The authentication, an authorization process that I mentioned in the last lesson you control those as well. 
Generally, if you require any operating systems or patches to those operating systems, that's also you. 
Any firewalls or firewall configuration that's also you. 
If you elect to use any encryption, which I'll talk about later in the course, that's also you. 
Now, don't worry, there's no way that I'm expecting you to remember all of this in detail at this stage. 
All I want this lesson to be is an introduction to the concept that when you do deploy things inside AWS, there's an element of shared responsibility. 
That's what this model means. 
Certain things you need to control and certain things are managed by AWS. 
Now the shared responsibility model that's something that I will mention extensively as I talk to you throughout this course, every AWS product is different. 
Some products you're responsible for very little of and other the products you control and are responsible for major components or even the majority of it. 
At this stage, I just want you to know what the model is so when I mention it later in the course, it makes sense. 
If you just take away the awareness that security responsibility inside AWS is shared at this stage, that's enough. 
Okay, so we're done for now, go ahead and mark this lesson as complete, and I'll see you in the next where we're going to talk about service models.
